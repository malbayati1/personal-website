            Hello and welcome! I am Muhammad H. Albayati. As you probably read at the top of the page, I am man with a diverse skill set,
            ranging from software developement, design, and production. This short list is not conslusive of my what I have done in my
            life. As a recent graduate of UC Irvine in Computer Game Science, I strive to make great products using those three skills
            I mentioned.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am based in San Diego county and currently I am interning for Orlando O Spencer I, Inc as a full stack developer, working
            on iOS in the front end, and in Node, Angular, and MongoDB in the back. In my spare time I like to work on this personal 
            website of mine, and to connect with the world. I try to make the world a little better place everyday however I can.
            Some hobbies of mine include video games and fitness. More recently I have been getting into reading. Please feel free to
            <a>contact me</a> if want to talk about an opportunity, or simply to connect as a fellow professional. Thanks for visiting!
        </p>
