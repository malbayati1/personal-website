                        Hello and welcome! My name is Muhammad H. Albayati and I love programming and video games.
                        In fact I love programming and video games so much, I decided to go and study Computer Game Science
                        at the University of California, Irvine. At UCI, I took programming, design, and project classes.
                        I also took on side projects making video games as a designer, programmer, and producer.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        I am currently finishing my last quarter at UCI, while working on my capstone project using the Unity
                        engine and C# for scripting. When I am not studying or working at either of my two jobs, you can find
                        me at the gym or socializing with my friends. If youâ€™re looking for a well rounded man that will never
                        quit to get the job done, look no further.
