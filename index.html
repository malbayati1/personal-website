            Hello and welcome! I am Muhammad H. Albayati. I am a man with a diverse skill set,
            working in different technologies and industries. My two main passions are software engineering and leadership.
            My goals in life are to make a positive impact in whatever I do, and help others be the best people they can be.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Currently, I'm a software engineer at Corelation Inc using C++ and SQL. As part of the conversion department, I code in C++ to 
            migrate client data from their old software to Corelation's Keystone platform. In my spare time I like to work on
            this personal
            website of mine, and to connect with the world. I try to make the world a little better place everyday
            however I can.
            Some hobbies of mine include video games and fitness. Please feel free to
            contact me if you have a question.
            Thanks for visiting!

                Cooking with Cain is a top down adventure/turn based RPG game. As lead on the team, I managed the
                teamwork and team dynamic. By using
                Git and <a href="https://github.com/KyleJinJones/Cooking-with-Cain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>, along with Trello, we
                had great success in developing the game.
                We worked on this project on our time, because we are passionate about video games and programming. This
                meant that it came with some
                challenges including members leaving and joining often, a leadership challenge that was difficult to tackle. However with successful
                management and oustanding teamwork we finished the game, and published it to
                <a href="https://malbayati.itch.io/cooking-with-cain-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a>.

                Waifu on Wheels was the final project that I had to work on and finish in order to graduate from
                UCI. I worked as a programmer and team lead of 5 people myself included. We decided to make a 3D car
                game with character interaction, driving, and collection elements. As a programmer, I repurposed a car
                physics script for our own purposes in the Untiy Engine, and we ended up having awesome car physics.
                As team lead, it was my job to facilite and design the workflow. With consultation with the team
                and discussion, we decided to use agile as our methodology. We also made extensive use of Trello to keep track of our tasks, and <a
                    href="https://github.com/UCI-TPL/169a-b-F19-W20-Pit-Stop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> to collaborate on the project.
                We ended up having an awesome 3D game with very interesting elements, and published it to
                <a href="https://malbayati.itch.io/waifu-on-wheels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a>.
