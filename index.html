            Hello and welcome! I am Muhammad H. Albayati. As you probably read at the top of the page, I am man with a
            diverse skill set,
            ranging from software developement, design, and production. This short list is not conslusive of my what I
            have done in my
            life. As a recent graduate of UC Irvine in Computer Game Science, I strive to make great products using
            those three skills
            I mentioned.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            I am based in San Diego county and currently I am interning for Orlando O Spencer I, Inc as a full stack
            developer, working

            this personal
            website of mine, and to connect with the world. I try to make the world a little better place everyday
            however I can.
            Some hobbies of mine include video games and fitness. More recently I have been getting into reading. Please
            feel free to

                Cooking with Cain is a top down adventure/turn based RPG game. As a producer on the team, I managed the
                teamwork and team dynamic. By using
                Git and <a href="https://github.com/KyleJinJones/Cooking-with-Cain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>, along with Trello, we
                had great success in developing the game.
                We worked on this project on our time, because we are passionate about video games and programming. This
                meant that it came with some
                challenges including members leaving and joining often. However, we pushed through and made an awesome
                game, and published it to
                <a href="https://malbayati.itch.io/cooking-with-cain-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a>.

                Waifu on Wheels was the final project that I had to work on and finish in order to graduate from
                UCI. I worked as a programmer and team lead of 5 people myself included. We decided to make a 3D car
                game with character interaction, driving, and collection elements. As a programmer, I repurposed a car
                physics script for our own purposes in the Untiy Engine, and we ended up having awesome car physics.
                We also made extensive use of Trello to keep track of our tasks, and <a
                    href="https://github.com/UCI-TPL/169a-b-F19-W20-Pit-Stop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> to collaborate on the project.
                We ended up having an awesome 3D game with very interesting elements, and published it to
                <a href="https://malbayati.itch.io/waifu-on-wheels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a>.
