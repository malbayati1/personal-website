    <p>
        Hello and welcome! My name is Muhammad H. Albayati and I love programming and video games.
        In fact I love programming and video games so much, I decided to go and study Computer Game Science
        at the University of California, Irvine. At UCI, I took programming, design, and project classes.
        I also took on side projects making video games as a designer, programmer, and producer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently finishing my last quarter at UCI, while working on my capstone project using the Unity
        engine and C# for scripting. When I am not studying or working at either of my two jobs, you can find
        me at the gym or socializing with my friends. If youâ€™re looking for a well rounded man that will never
        quit to get the job done, look no further.
    </p>
